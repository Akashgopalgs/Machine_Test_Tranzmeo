# Machine Test - Tranzmeo

## Overview
This repository contains the solution for the Tranzmeo Machine Test. The project involves analyzing and visualizing data using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), handle missing values, and provide meaningful insights.

## Dataset
The dataset provided contains various attributes related to the problem statement. Key tasks include:
- Reading and cleaning the data
- Handling missing values
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing key insights
- Generating statistical summaries


## Running the Notebook
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine_test_tranzmeo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd machine_test_tranzmeo
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook machine_test_tranzmeo.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially.

## Features
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Handling missing values using Pandas
- Data visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Statistical analysis and insights extraction
- Exporting cleaned data for further use

## Results & Insights
- Summary statistics of the dataset
- Key trends and patterns identified in the data
- Graphical representation of data distributions
- Handling outliers and missing values efficiently

## Conclusion

The analysis provided valuable insights into the dataset, revealing important trends and patterns. By handling missing values and visualizing data distributions, we identified key correlations and anomalies. The approach taken ensures a structured workflow for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, which can be applied to similar datasets for meaningful decision-making.
